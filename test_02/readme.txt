This directory contains the second iteration of a JavaScript image manager dynamic model website.
 This version includes basic styling and structure for the website, but the images are not yet loaded
 onto the site. Instead, the gallery names and default image icon are displayed. The website allows for
 pagination, with a set number of galleries per page. The site is structured using HTML and CSS, with 
dynamic content being generated using JavaScript.

It's important to note that the images' paths in the JSON file should be relative to the website directory.
Users may need to manually check and edit the paths if necessary. One helpful tipis to use the "Select and 
Modify All Occurrences of Find Match" feature (Ctrl+L on VS Code) to quickly update the paths if needed.

Please note that this version is not a final product, and further development is still needed to fully 
implement the website's intended functionality.
