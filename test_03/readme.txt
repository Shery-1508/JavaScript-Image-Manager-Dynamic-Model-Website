The "test_03" update adds a new "gallery" feature to the website. Now, on the main page, the models are randomized and their galleries are displayed.
When a user clicks on a model's gallery, they are directed to a new "gallery" page where all the image thumbnails for that model are displayed.

Clicking on any thumbnail image on the gallery page will open the full-sized version of the image in a new tab. This feature allows users to browse 
through all the images associated with a particular model easily.

It's important to note that the images' paths in the JSON file should be relative (not absolute paths) to the to the website directory. Users may need to manually
check and edit the paths if necessary. One helpful tip is to use the "Select and Modify All Occurrences of Find Match" feature (Ctrl+L on VS Code) to 
quickly update the paths if needed.

Overall, this update provides users with an improved browsing experience by allowing them to easily access and view all images associated with
each model on the website.
